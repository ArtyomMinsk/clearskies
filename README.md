# ClearSkies

## Description

ClearSkies is the web application that allows a general aviation pilot to specify the waypoints
of a flight plan (by unique airport identifier) and returns the cloud base information
along the route.
This app utilizes the Google Maps API to draw a map of the flight plan and plot
color-coded markers to represent the cloud conditions.

## Motivation

Currently, general aviation pilots have two options to get cloud base information when developing a flight plan. They can call flight service and have a report read to them over the phone, or they can use an app that returns the raw, unparsed METAR data along their route. Neither are especially helpful in displaying the relevant data in a clear or meaningful manner.
